### Description
This repo includes the files needed for a pacman project.   

### What does it do?
The project simulates a pacman moving back and forth across the screen.   
It does this by using four different pacman images and using the DOM to move the image across the screen and reversing when it hits the edge of the screen.  

### Roadmap
I am planning to figure out how to get the onclick functionality up in the future.
